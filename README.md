Here is my solution for a small programming task:
The Task was to write a small application in either JS or TS.
This application should let a user input a url and while input check if the url is valid.
If the url is valid it would be send of to a server that would then check if the url exists and if it leads to a file or a folder (While this part in not actually codet but only mocked).
The data the server gatherd should then be send back and displayd to the user.

I only used Vanilla TS and while I did the full frontend part as asked I only did a one way backend for the purpose of a mock.
But it would be easy enought to do the other part as well if wished.
